# EvenParity-LinearBlockCode.
<br>This code helps to find the linear-block-code.<br/>
<br>There are three main rules to check if it's linear-block-code.<br/>
<ul>
  <li>There should be a codeword that should be a all zeros</li>
  <li>The sum of two codewords should be a codewordword in the list</li>
  <li>Minimum distance of two codeword should be minimum hamming weightof the list</li>
</ul>
